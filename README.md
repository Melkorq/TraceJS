# TraceJS

**TraceJS** is a simple yet powerful C# console application designed to help you identify URLs and paths within a given web page.
It analyzes both inline and external JavaScript as well as the raw HTML content, using regular expressions to extract potential endpoints, file paths, and network calls â€” making it a handy tool for understanding whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes of any website.
